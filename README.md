## ℹ️ About

**Altira** is a personal project developed to assist users with navigation using a compass and altimeter.

After careful consideration, I have decided not to publish or distribute this app due to its potential safety-critical nature and to avoid any risk of harm. Therefore, it will remain a personal, non-public project.  

## ✨ Features

- **Compass** with a custom design inspired by the app icon  
- **Vertical altimeter** with smooth animation and dynamic scaling  
- GPS-based altitude correction using the EGM geoid model  
- Support for both light and dark themes  

The app does **not** collect any personal data. The only permissions requested are those needed to access sensors and location data.
